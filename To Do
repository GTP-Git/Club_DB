Admin Tools
_________

-- Need a way to upload new words lists, such as when NASPA updates the dictionary

-- When the program is deploayed, I will update it. The update MUST maintain the current db. How to?

-- Button that reports total number of records

Data Entry
_________


Reports
_________

-- Need support for 9+-letter bingos

-- List all bingos by a player along with their probability

-- Head-to-head comparison of two players??

-- Create a "Full Player Report" which has basically everything possible about that one player

-- If blanks are recorded, all sorts of data. Average score with 0,1,2, W/L record with 0,1,2, etc. How much does score increase per blank?

-- Avg spread

-- Show score by number of bingos. Caluclate, then, how much a bingo is worth.









Charts
_________

-- Histogram of bingos by quartile

-- Histogram of scores

-- Running average of bingo prob by player?

-- Scatterplot of bingos by prob by player(s)




Cool Ideas
_________

-- Allow for searching by bingo letter string, so that, for instance, you can run a promo for Most Bingos Starting With 'ANTI'

-- Figure out a cool icon for the program. Maybe something combining Scrabble with databases?




Done
_________


-- Add delete and search for record

-- Add date range picker for reports

-- When entering bingos, should we add a word validation warning. Caution: ANEROOD is not a valid word. Enter anyway? This will allow the entry of phonies or catch errors.

-- Make reports dynamically sized

-- Show heatmap by W/L record, as well as by win%

-- Highest game score

-- Total number of games

-- Need option to either save to text file or open in window.
